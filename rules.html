    <div class= "content">
      The game of P, R, S is based on trust, skill and determination.
      Each player must:
      <ul>
        <li>make a fist with one hand and hold the other open, palm upward</li>
        <li> at the same time, they tap their fists in their open palms once, twice, and on the third time form one of three items</li>
        <ul>
          <li> a rock (by keeping the hand in a fist)</li>
          <li> a sheet of paper (by holding the hand flat, palm down)</li>
          <li> or a pair of scissors (by extending the first two fingers and holding them apart) </li>
        </ul>
      </ul>
      If the same item is thrown, it's a tie.
      Other wise,
      <ul>
        <li> Rock beats Scissors </li>
        <li> Scissors beats Paper </li>
        <li> Paper beats Rock </li>
      </ul>
